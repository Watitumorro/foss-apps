**BetterBatteryStats**: Analyse the behavior of your phone, find applications causing the phone to drain battery while it is supposed to be asleep and measure the effect of corrective actions: spot drainers based on detailed information about the root cause, detect changes in the awake/sleep profile and quickly find the causes (rogue apps).
