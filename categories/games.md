**Shattered Pixel Dungeon**: Based on the original Pixel Dungeon source code, Shattered is much more balanced and features additional content in the game. It has a bigger learning curve then vanilla since the game is bigger however it is designed in a way where every run is winnable if you know exactly what you are doing.

**TalpaSplat3**: Shameless self-plug. A simple and fun FOSS cross-platform game. Tap on the mole as many times as you can before the time runs out, but watch out for the bombs!
